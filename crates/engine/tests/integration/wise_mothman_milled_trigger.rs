//! Regression: GitHub issue #406 — The Wise Mothman ("Whenever one or more
//! nonland cards are milled, …") and the broader milled-trigger class.
//!
//! Bug: the Oracle parser never emitted `TriggerMode::Milled` for any
//! "…cards are milled" / "…mills a card" condition. Every milled-trigger card
//! (The Wise Mothman, Glowing One, Infesting Radroach, Mirelurk Queen,
//! Screeching Scorchbeast, Zellix Sanity Flayer) parsed its mill trigger to
//! `TriggerMode::Unknown`, so the trigger never fired even though the runtime
//! matcher (`game/trigger_matchers.rs::match_milled`) was already correct.
//!
//! Fix: `parser/oracle_trigger.rs::try_parse_event` now recognizes both the
//! passive ("are milled") and active ("mills <object>") mill predicates and
//! emits `TriggerMode::Milled` (CR 701.17a). The "one or more …" batched
//! semantics are stamped by the existing caller plumbing (`def.batched`).
//!
//! These tests drive a *real* mill through `apply` — a Tome Scour spell
//! ("Target player mills five cards") resolves and produces genuine
//! `ZoneChanged { from: Library, to: Graveyard }` events — and assert the
//! milled trigger fires as a consequence. No synthetic `GameEvent` is injected.

//
// Two coupled defects lived in
// `game/engine_stack.rs::handle_trigger_target_selection_{select_targets,
// choose_target}`:
//
//   * BUG 1 (CR 601.2c + CR 603.2c): `multi_target.max = EventContextAmount`
//     reads `state.current_trigger_match_count`, which is stamped only while a
//     trigger surfaces its prompt and is `None` again by the *later* `apply()`
//     that completes the target walk. So the assignment re-resolved the bound to
//     0, consumed 0 of the selected slots, and returned
//     `InvalidAction("Unused selected targets")` (the all-at-once `SelectTargets`
//     path) / `InvalidAction("Unused selected target slots")` (the step-by-step
//     `ChooseTarget` path) even though the player had chosen legal creatures.
//
//   * BUG 2 (CR 603.3d): the handlers took `state.pending_trigger` *before* the
//     fallible assignment. `apply()` does not roll back on `Err`, and
//     `sync_waiting_for` never runs after an `Err`, so the Bug-1 error left
//     `pending_trigger = None` while `waiting_for` was still
//     `TriggerTargetSelection` — bricking every subsequent action.
//
// The fix re-stamps `current_trigger_match_count` (save/restore) around the
