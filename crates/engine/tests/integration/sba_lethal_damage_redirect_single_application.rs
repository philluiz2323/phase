//! Phase C pre-work (C0b) diagnostic: a lethal-damage death redirected back to
//! the battlefield must re-enter EXACTLY ONCE per SBA fixpoint, applying its
//! CR 614.1c enters-with-additional-counter static exactly once.
//!
//! During Phase B testing, driving the full `check_state_based_actions` fixpoint
//! against a lethal-damage death redirected to the battlefield (under an "enters
//! with an additional +1/+1 counter" static) stacked counters far above 1 — the
//! same entry was re-delivered repeatedly within one SBA fixpoint even though
//! `reset_for_battlefield_entry` clears `damage_marked`.
//!
//! Root cause: the redirected delivery is a Battlefield->Battlefield ZoneChange,
//! which the CR 603.2g no-op guard rejects — `reset_for_battlefield_entry` never
//! runs, lethal `damage_marked` survives, and every fixpoint pass re-derives the
//! same destruction. The fix scrubs the marked damage after the redirect
//! delivers: a "remains on the battlefield instead of dying" effect is
//! regeneration-shaped (CR 701.19a/b — destruction is replaced by "remove all
//! damage marked on it" while the permanent stays the same object), so the
//! creature must NOT be re-destroyed for the already-replaced damage.
//!
//! This drives the real SBA pipeline (mark lethal damage -> repeated
//! `check_state_based_actions` -> inner ZoneChange propose -> replace_event
//! redirect to battlefield -> deliver), and asserts the redirected creature ends
//! with exactly ONE +1/+1 counter.
