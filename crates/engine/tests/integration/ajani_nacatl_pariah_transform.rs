//! Regression test for GitHub issue #503 — Ajani, Nacatl Pariah's transform
//! trigger.
//!
//! Ajani, Nacatl Pariah's second trigger is "Whenever one or more other Cats
//! you control die, you may exile Ajani, then return him to the battlefield
//! transformed under his owner's control."
//!
//! The reported bug: when another Cat died, Ajani exiled itself but never
//! returned transformed. Root cause was a parser anaphor mis-binding — the
//! pronoun "him" in clause 2 ("return him ... transformed") bound to the
//! triggering source (the dying Cat) instead of to Ajani, the object named by
//! `~` in clause 1 ("exile ~"). At resolution the engine then moved/transform-
//! no-op'd the dead Cat and left Ajani stranded in exile.
//!
//! The fix is parser-only: a guarded post-clause anaphoric-rewrite arm in
//! `parse_effect_chain_ir` rebinds the pronoun to `SelfRef` when a preceding
//! clause named the source via `~`. This test drives the real `apply`
//! pipeline (kill a Cat → trigger fires → resolve) and asserts Ajani returns
//! to the battlefield transformed to his Avenger (planeswalker) back face.
//!
//! CR 608.2c: "read the whole text ... apply the rules of English" — the
//! anaphor "him" binds to the named antecedent in the preceding clause.
//! CR 712.14 / 712.14a: a double-faced card put onto the battlefield
//! transformed enters with its back face up.
