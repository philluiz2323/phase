//! Phase C3 review fix (round-3, Fix 1) discriminating test: a countered spell
//! whose graveyard move surfaces a CR 616.1 ordering choice must PARK the
//! prompt — not strand the spell as a zone ghost.
//!
//! `zone_pipeline::move_object` did not park `state.waiting_for` on
//! `NeedsChoice` (`replace_event` sets only `pending_replacement`); the C3
//! counter.rs arms bailed with `return Ok(())` under a comment falsely claiming
//! the pipeline parks. Under TWO simultaneously-applicable graveyard→exile
//! redirects (Rest in Peace + Leyline of the Void, or two RIP copies — RIP is
//! not legendary), a countered spell was: removed from the stack,
//! `SpellCountered` emitted, its move parked in `pending_replacement`, and the
//! prompt NEVER surfaced (the engine gates `ChooseReplacement` on the wait
//! state) — permanently ghosting the spell (off `state.stack` but
//! `obj.zone == Stack`).
//!
//! The fix centralizes the park inside the pipeline (`execute_zone_move`'s
//! `replace_event` NeedsChoice arm calls `replacement::park_waiting_for`), so
//! every single-move caller — counter, bounce, and all future C5–C9 migrations
//! — is safe by construction.
//!
//! This test counters a spell under two redirects, asserts the CR 616.1 prompt
//! SURFACES, answers it via a real `GameAction::ChooseReplacement` dispatch, and
//! asserts the spell ends in EXILE with no ghost left behind (consistent zone,
//! `pending_replacement` clear). FAILS pre-fix at the prompt-surfaced assertion
//! (waiting_for never left Priority; the spell ghosted on the Stack zone).
