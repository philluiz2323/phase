//! Runtime regression for the Yuriko, the Tiger's Shadow combat-damage trigger
//! — the bare-anaphoric-possessive sibling of Dark Confidant (issue #511).
//!
//! Oracle text: "Whenever a Ninja you control deals combat damage to a player,
//! reveal the top card of your library and put that card into your hand. Each
//! opponent loses life equal to that card's mana value."
//!
//! Before the fix, "that card's mana value" parsed to
//! `ObjectManaValue { scope: ObjectScope::CostPaidObject }`. At runtime that
//! scope's fallback order is `cost_paid_object → trigger-event source →
//! effect_context_object`. Yuriko's trigger has no cost-paid object, so slot 2
//! (the trigger-event source = the *Ninja that dealt combat damage*) won —
//! and the opponent lost life equal to the Ninja's mana value instead of the
//! revealed card's. When Yuriko herself was the attacker the discrepancy
//! manifested as the user's reported bug: "it does her mana cost in damage
//! [sic; life loss] instead of the revealed card's mana cost."
//!
//! Fix: `classify_possessive_referent` in `parser/oracle_quantity.rs` now
//! returns `ObjectScope::Anaphoric` for the bare anaphoric prefix class
//! ("that card", "that creature", "that spell", "the creature"). The runtime
//! `Anaphoric` arm of `resolve_object_mana_value` reads
//! `effect_context_object` first (the revealed card snapshot stamped by the
//! parent `RevealTop` → child `ChangeZone` chain), then the trigger source,
//! then `cost_paid_object` — the inverse slot order, which is what CR 608.2c
//! requires for anaphora introduced by an earlier instruction in the same
//! ability.
//!
//! CR references (verified against `docs/MagicCompRules.txt`):
//!   - CR 119.3: "lose life" decreases the player's life total. The authorizing
//!     rule for the trigger's effect — life loss, not damage. (The reporter
//!     said "damage" but Yuriko's text reads "loses life".)
//!   - CR 119.2: damage to a player normally causes that player to lose life.
//!   - CR 510.1b + CR 510.2: a creature deals combat damage equal to its power
//!     in the combat damage step (the trigger event for Yuriko).
//!   - CR 603.2: a triggered ability's condition is checked against game events;
//!     the trigger-event source is the object referenced by that event (the
//!     Ninja that dealt combat damage, in Yuriko's case).
//!   - CR 603.7c: the controller follows a triggered ability's instructions in
//!     the order written.
//!   - CR 608.2c: anaphora binds to the earlier-instruction referent in the
//!     same resolution (the revealed card, not the trigger source).
//!   - CR 608.2h: LKI applies once the referenced object moves to a hidden
//!     zone (the revealed card moves Library → Hand during the same chain).
//!   - CR 608.2k: an effect can refer to a specific untargeted object named
//!     by the ability's cost or trigger condition — this is the *other*
//!     anaphora rule that the participle-possessive class ("the sacrificed
//!     creature's power") binds to, but NOT the rule that licenses "that
//!     card's" after a reveal.
//!   - CR 701.20 + CR 701.20b: revealing a card does not move it from its
//!     zone; the parent `RevealTop` followed by a `ChangeZone` to Hand is the
//!     reveal-then-move primitive that stamps the revealed object into
//!     `effect_context_object` for the chained life-loss instruction.
//!   - CR 202.3: an object's mana value is the converted total of its mana
//!     cost — the quantity the resolver reads off the revealed card.
