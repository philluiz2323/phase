//! Regression: Urza, Lord High Artificer's third ability —
//! "{5}: Shuffle your library, then exile the top card. Until end of turn, you
//! may play that card without paying its mana cost."
//!
//! Before the fix the clause misparsed into a whole-library TUTOR (a generic
//! `ChangeZone` over the entire library that opened a `WaitingFor::
//! EffectZoneChoice` selection prompt) plus a `CastFromZone { target:
//! ParentTarget }` that bound to nothing. The correct parse is a deterministic
//! top-of-library exile followed by a tracked-set free-cast grant:
//!
//!   Shuffle{Controller}
//!     -> ExileTop { player: Controller, count: Fixed(1) }
//!     -> CastFromZone { target: TrackedSet(0), without_paying_mana_cost: true,
//!                       mode: Play, duration: UntilEndOfTurn }
//!
//! CR 701.24a: after the shuffle the library order is RANDOM, so the exiled top
//! card is fixed by post-shuffle order — the player makes NO selection. The
//! ABSENCE of a tutor prompt is the rules-correct behavior. CR 118.9 + CR 601.2a:
//! the exiled card is then castable for free until end of turn.
