//! Spikeshell Harrier — player-property superlative-comparison conditional
//! speed-decrease (#341).
//!
//! Oracle: "When this creature enters, return target creature or Vehicle an
//! opponent controls to its owner's hand. If that opponent's speed is greater
//! than each other player's speed, reduce that opponent's speed by 1. This
//! effect can't reduce their speed below 1."
//!
//! Three #341 gaps proven end-to-end:
//!   1. `Effect::ChangeSpeed { direction: Decrease, floor: Some(1) }` — the
//!      speed-decrease effect, floored at 1.
//!   2. The chained sub-ability's `AbilityCondition::QuantityCheck` gate
//!      (CR 608.2c) — a resolution-time conditional second effect, NOT a
//!      trigger intervening-if.
//!   3. The "that opponent" anaphor → the bounced object's controller
//!      (`PlayerScope` / `PlayerFilter::ParentObjectTargetController`).
//!
//! Drives the real cast -> stack -> ETB trigger -> bounce -> conditional
//! sub-ability check -> `ChangeSpeed` pipeline through `apply`. The ETB
//! trigger has exactly one legal bounce target (P1's lone creature), so it
//! auto-resolves during stack advancement. This is a pipeline test, not a
//! shape test.
//!
//! CR references (verified against docs/MagicCompRules.txt):
//!   - CR 603.3: once an ability triggers, its controller puts it on the stack.
//!   - CR 608.2c: the controller follows the ability's instructions in the
//!     order written; a condition gating a later instruction is evaluated as
//!     the ability resolves.
//!   - CR 702.179f: an effect that refers to speed treats "no speed" as 0.
