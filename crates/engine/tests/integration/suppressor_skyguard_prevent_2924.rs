//! Issue #2924 — Suppressor Skyguard end-to-end combat-damage prevention.
//!
//! Oracle text: "Flying\nWhenever a player attacks you, if that player has
//! another opponent who isn't being attacked, prevent all combat damage that
//! would be dealt to you this combat."
//!
//! The original bug report is "no combat damage is prevented in real combat."
//! Earlier regression tests pinned the individual links (the intervening-if
//! count resolves correctly at detection, the resolver stamps an
//! `UntilEndOfCombat` prevention shield, and the parser produces the right
//! AST), but none drove the *integrated* pipeline: a real attack declaration in
//! multiplayer → the trigger fires and resolves → a prevention shield is
//! created on the attacked player → combat damage is actually prevented →
//! the attacked player's life is unchanged.
//!
//! These tests drive the full `apply` pipeline. The discriminator is the
//! attacked player's life total after combat damage:
//!   - APPLY: P1 attacks ONLY P0 while P2 (P1's other opponent) is un-attacked
//!     → the intervening-if is satisfied → all combat damage to P0 is
//!     prevented → P0's life is UNCHANGED.
//!   - CONTROL: P1 attacks BOTH P0 and P2 → P1 has no un-attacked opponent →
//!     the intervening-if is FALSE → no shield → P0 LOSES life equal to the
//!     attacker's power. Same board minus one attack declaration flips the
//!     outcome, proving the multiplayer condition + prevention work end-to-end
//!     (not merely that prevention works when a shield exists).
//!   - GUARD (2-player): P1 attacks P0 but P1 has no other opponent → the
//!     intervening-if is FALSE → P0 takes damage.
//!
//! CR references (verified against docs/MagicCompRules.txt):
//!   - CR 506.2 + CR 508.6: a player is "being attacked" when an attacker is
//!     declared against them; the un-attacked-opponent count is read from the
//!     real declare-attackers ledger.
//!   - CR 603.4: the intervening "if" is checked when the trigger would fire and
//!     again on resolution; if false at either point the ability does nothing.
//!   - CR 510.1c / CR 120.1: combat damage is dealt during the combat damage
//!     step and reduces the recipient's life.
//!   - CR 615.1: a prevention shield replaces the would-be damage with nothing.
