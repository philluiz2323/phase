//! Regression: GitHub issue #323 — Treasured Find ("Return target card from
//! your graveyard to your hand. Exile Treasured Find.").
//!
//! User report (Discord, 2026-05-09): the resolver was producing the inverse
//! of the printed effect. Diagnosis: `Effect::Bounce.destination` was silently
//! ignored by the single-target bounce resolver — only `BounceAll` honored it.
//! For Treasured Find specifically, the parser emits
//! `Bounce { target: Typed[Card, controller=You, InZone=Graveyard], destination: None }`
//! plus a chained `ChangeZone { target: SelfRef, destination: Exile }` for the
//! self-exile clause. With the resolver fix in `effects/bounce.rs`, the
//! `destination: None` default explicitly resolves to `Hand` (mirroring
//! `BounceAll`'s `unwrap_or(Zone::Hand)`), making the field meaningful for
//! future parser branches.
//!
//! End-to-end assertion: after casting Treasured Find with a card pre-loaded
//! into the controller's graveyard, the targeted card returns to hand and
//! Treasured Find itself ends up in exile (CR 608.2c — "the controller of
//! the spell or ability follows its instructions in the order written").

/// Issue #323: target returns to hand, Treasured Find self-exiles.
///
/// Pre-fix behavior: the bounce resolver hard-coded `Zone::Hand` and ignored
/// the `destination` field entirely; user-visible symptom was Treasured Find
/// landing in the graveyard instead of exile (the post-resolution
/// stack→graveyard fallback won the race against the silently-ignored
/// destination override). The architectural fix unifies single-target Bounce
/// with `BounceAll`'s `destination.unwrap_or(Zone::Hand)` pattern.
