//! Runtime regression for issue #511 (and #512a) — anaphoric "its" in a
//! triggered ability binds to the object an earlier *effect instruction*
//! introduced, not to the cost-paid object.
//!
//! Dark Confidant: "At the beginning of your upkeep, reveal the top card of
//! your library and put that card into your hand. You lose life equal to its
//! mana value." The "its" refers to the *revealed* card.
//!
//! Root cause (pre-fix): `RevealTop` emits `GameEvent::CardsRevealed`, not a
//! `ZoneChanged` (CR 701.20b — revealing does not move the card). The chained
//! `ChangeZone` moves the card to Hand, a hidden zone. The instruction-order
//! referent extractor `parent_referent_context_from_events` recognized only
//! sacrifice and public-zone moves, so the revealed card was never captured
//! into `effect_context_object`. The grandchild `LoseLife`'s
//! `ObjectManaValue{ Anaphoric }` arm then fell through every slot to
//! `unwrap_or(0)` → Dark Confidant's controller lost 0 life.
//!
//! Fix: (1) `revealed_object_context_from_events` captures the single revealed
//! card's LKI snapshot at reveal time (CR 608.2h — once the card moves to a
//! hidden zone, LKI applies). (2) the `Anaphoric` runtime arm consults
//! `effect_context_object` (CR 608.2c instruction-order referent) first,
//! before the CR 608.2k trigger-condition / cost referents.
//!
//! CR references (verified against docs/MagicCompRules.txt):
//!   - CR 608.2c: a spell or ability's controller follows its instructions in
//!     the order written; anaphora reads the whole text per English rules.
//!   - CR 608.2h: an effect uses last-known information when the object it
//!     refers to has moved from a public zone to a hidden zone.
//!   - CR 608.2k: an effect referring to an object previously named by the
//!     ability's cost or trigger condition still affects that object.
//!   - CR 701.20b: revealing a card doesn't cause it to leave its zone.
//!
//! Non-interference note (plan B6 double-bind trace): `RevealTop` also writes
//! `state.last_revealed_ids`, consumed by the effect chain to inject revealed
//! card IDs as *targets* for an else-branch sub-ability following a peek. Dark
//! Confidant has no else branch and its sub-`ChangeZone` carries an explicit
//! `ParentTarget`; the grandchild `LoseLife` reads a quantity, not a target.
//! The new `effect_context_object` path and the `last_revealed_ids` target
//! injection therefore do not double-bind for this card.
