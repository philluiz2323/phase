//! Runtime regression for issue #1502 — multiple suspended cards owned by the
//! same player must each lose a time counter at the beginning of that player's
//! upkeep. Only the first suspended card's upkeep trigger was firing; subsequent
//! suspended cards retained all of their time counters indefinitely.
//!
//! CR references (verified against docs/MagicCompRules.txt):
//!   - CR 603.2: a game event triggers every triggered ability whose trigger
//!     event it matches — once per source instance.
//!   - CR 603.3: each triggered ability is put on the stack the next time a
//!     player would receive priority; one ability per triggering instance.
//!   - CR 702.62a: "At the beginning of your upkeep, if this card is suspended,
//!     remove a time counter from it." Synthesized for every Suspend keyword.
//!
//! The trigger is synthesized per-source by
//! `KeywordTriggerInstaller::triggers_for(&Keyword::Suspend{..})` and the exile
//! scan in `collect_pending_triggers` iterates every object in `state.exile`,
//! so the per-source firing contract must hold end-to-end: with two suspended
//! cards in exile, both must decrement by exactly one each upkeep.
//!
//! The test is hand-built (no `CardDatabase`) so it remains discriminating even
//! when the exported `card-data.json` schema drifts ahead of the engine on a
//! work-in-progress branch — `CardDatabase::from_export` returns an error in
//! that window, which would otherwise mask the bug under an early-return.
