//! Regression: GitHub issue #524 — Devour Intellect's "instead" rider never
//! fires.
//!
//! Devour Intellect is a black sorcery:
//!   "Target opponent discards a card. If mana from a Treasure was spent to
//!    cast this spell, instead that player reveals their hand, you choose a
//!    nonland card from it, then that player discards that card."
//!
//! The `ConditionInstead` rider is gated by a `QuantityCheck` over
//! `QuantityRef::ManaSpentToCast`. The parser hardcoded `scope:
//! TriggeringSpell`; for a resolving sorcery referring to "this spell" that
//! scope resolves against `state.current_trigger_event`, which is `None`
//! during ordinary spell resolution — so the comparison was always `0 > 0`
//! (false) and the upgraded effect never ran.
//!
//! The fix makes the subject anaphora ("this spell" → `SelfObject`, "that
//! spell" → `TriggeringSpell`) drive the scope at parse time (CR 400.7d).
//!
//! Discriminating signal: the upgraded ("instead") branch runs
//! `Effect::RevealHand`, which sets `WaitingFor::RevealChoice` and marks the
//! opponent's cards as revealed. The base branch runs `Effect::Discard` and
//! never reveals. We assert on `RevealChoice` / `revealed_cards` — a pure
//! shape test that hand-built the condition would not catch the
//! `current_trigger_event == None` runtime failure, so this drives the full
//! cast/resolve pipeline.
