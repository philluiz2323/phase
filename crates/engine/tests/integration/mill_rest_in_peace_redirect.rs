//! Phase C1 (zone-change pipeline) discriminating test for the
//! mill-honors-Moved-redirect bug-fix.
//!
//! Before Phase C1, `mill::apply_mill_after_replacement` delivered each milled
//! card with a bare `zones::move_to_zone(state, obj_id, destination, events)`.
//! That raw move never proposed a per-card `ZoneChange`, so `Moved`-level
//! redirects ("if a card would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, exile it
//! instead" — Rest in Peace / Leyline of the Void class) were silently dropped
//! for milled cards: a milled card landed in the graveyard even with Rest in
//! Peace on the battlefield. (PLAN §8 Risk #1; confirmed bug.)
//!
//! Phase C1 routes each milled card through `zone_pipeline::move_object`, which
//! proposes the inner `ZoneChange` and consults the `Moved` replacements before
//! delivery.
//!
//! This drives the real mill pipeline (resolve `Effect::Mill` -> Mill-level
//! replacement pass -> per-card `move_object` -> `replace_event` graveyard->exile
//! redirect -> deliver) with a global Rest-in-Peace-style replacement in play,
//! and asserts the milled cards end in EXILE, not the graveyard. It FAILS on the
//! old raw-`move_to_zone` delivery (cards reach the graveyard) and passes through
//! the pipeline.
